What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It lets git know of the repository and allows it to start tracking files in that repository. Init is needed to get git to 'look' at the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows us to have greater control on what is commited from a repository. It is a placeholder in comparison with the working directory.
